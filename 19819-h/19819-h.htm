<p>Few poems have been more variously designated than <i>Comus</i>.
Milton himself describes it simply as &ldquo;A Mask&rdquo;; by others
it has been criticised and estimated as a lyrical drama, a drama in
the epic style, a lyric poem in the <i>form</i> of a play, a phantasy,
an allegory, a philosophical poem, a suite of speeches or majestic
soliloquies, and even a didactic poem. Such variety in the description
of the poem is explained partly by its complex charm and many-sided
interest, and partly by the desire to describe it from that point of
view which should best reconcile its literary form with what we know
of the genius and powers of its author. Those who, like Dr. Johnson,
have blamed it as a drama, have admired it &ldquo;as a series of
lines,&rdquo; or as a lyric; one writer, who has found that its
characters are nothing, its sentiments tedious, its story
uninteresting, has nevertheless &ldquo;doubted whether there will ever
be any similar poem which gives so true a conception of the capacity
and the dignity of the mind by which it was produced&rdquo;
(Bagehot&rsquo;s <i>Literary Studies</i>). Some who have praised it as
an allegory see in it a satire on the evils both of the Church and of
the State, while others regard it as alluding to the vices of the
Court alone. Some have found its lyrical parts the <a
class="pagebreak" name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii" title="viii"></a>best,
while others, charmed with its &ldquo;divine philosophy,&rdquo; have
commended those deep conceits which place it alongside of the
<i>Faerie Queen</i>, as shadowing forth an episode in the education of
a noble soul and as a poet&rsquo;s lesson against intemperance and
impurity. But no one can refuse to admit that, more than any other of
Milton&rsquo;s shorter poems, it gives us an insight into the peculiar
genius and character of its author: it was, in the opinion of Hallam,
&ldquo;sufficient to convince any one of taste and feeling that a
great poet had arisen in England, and one partly formed in a different
school from his contemporaries.&rdquo; It is true that in the early
poems we do not find the whole of Milton, for he had yet to pass
through many years of trouble and controversy; but <i>Comus</i>, in a
special degree, reveals or foreshadows much of the Milton of
<i>Paradise Lost</i>. Whether we regard its place in Milton&rsquo;s
life, in the series of his works, or in English literature as a whole,
the poem is full of significance: it is worth while, therefore, to
consider how its form was determined by the external circumstances and
previous training of the poet; by his favourite studies in poetry,
philosophy, history, and music; and by his noble theory of life in
general, and of a poet&rsquo;s life in particular.</p>

<p>The mask was represented at Ludlow Castle on September 29th, 1634;
it was probably composed early in that year. It belongs, therefore, to
that group of poems (<i>L&rsquo;Allegro</i>, <i>Il Penseroso</i>,
<i>Arcades</i>, <i>Comus</i>, and <i>Lycidas</i>) written by Milton
while living in his father&rsquo;s house at Horton, near Windsor,
after having left the University of Cambridge in July, 1632. As he was
born in 1608, he would be twenty-five years of age when this poem was
<a class="pagebreak" name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix"
title="ix"></a>composed.
During his stay at Horton (1632-39), which was broken only by a
journey to Italy in 1638-9, he was chiefly occupied with the study of
the Greek, Roman, Italian, and English literatures, each of which has
left its impress on <i>Comus</i>. He read widely and carefully, and it
has been said that his great and original imagination was almost
entirely nourished, or at least stimulated, by books: his residence at
Horton was, accordingly, pre-eminently what he intended it to be, and
what his father wisely and gladly permitted it to be&mdash;a time of
preparation and ripening for the work to which he had dedicated
himself. We are reminded of his own words in <i>Comus</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">And Wisdom&rsquo;s self<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oft seeks to sweet retired solitude,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where, with her best nurse, Contemplation,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She plumes her feathers, and lets grow her wings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, in the various bustle of resort,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were all to-ruffled, and sometimes impaired.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We find in <i>Comus</i> abundant reminiscences of Milton&rsquo;s
study of the literature of antiquity. &ldquo;It would not be too much
to say that the literature of antiquity was to Milton&rsquo;s genius
what soil and light are to a plant. It nourished, it coloured, it
developed it. It determined not merely his character as an artist, but
it exercised an influence on his intellect and temper scarcely less
powerful than hereditary instincts and contemporary history. It at
once animated and chastened his imagination; it modified his fancy; it
furnished him with his models. On it his taste was formed; on it his
style was moulded. From it his diction and his method derived
<a class="pagebreak" name="Page_x" id="Page_x" title="x"></a>their
peculiarities. It transformed what would in all probability have been
the mere counterpart of Caedmon&rsquo;s Paraphrase or Langland&rsquo;s
Vision into Paradise Lost; and what would have been the mere
counterpart of Corydon&rsquo;s Doleful Knell and the satire of the
Three Estates, into Lycidas and Comus.&rdquo; (<i>Quarterly
Review</i>, No. 326.)</p>

<p>But Milton has also told us that Spenser was his master, and the
full charm of <i>Comus</i> cannot be realised without reference to the
artistic and philosophical spirit of the author of the <i>Faerie
Queene</i>. Both poems deal with the war between the body and the
soul&mdash;between the lower and the higher nature. In an essay on
&lsquo;Spenser as a philosophic poet,&rsquo; De Vere says: &ldquo;The
perils and degradations of an animalised life are shown under the
allegory of Sir Guyon&rsquo;s sea voyage with its successive storms
and whirlpools, its &lsquo;rock of Reproach&rsquo; strewn with wrecks
and dead men&rsquo;s bones, its &lsquo;wandering islands,&rsquo; its
&lsquo;quicksands of Unthriftihead,&rsquo; its &lsquo;whirlepoole of
Decay,&rsquo; its &lsquo;sea-monsters,&rsquo; and lastly, its
&lsquo;bower of Bliss,&rsquo; and the doom which overtakes it,
together with the deliverance of Acrasia&rsquo;s victims, transformed
by that witch&rsquo;s spells into beasts. Still more powerful is the
allegory of worldly ambition, illustrated under the name of &lsquo;the
cave of Mammon.&rsquo; The Legend of Holiness delineates with not less
insight those enemies which wage war upon the spiritual life.&rdquo;
All this Milton had studied in the <i>Faerie Queene</i>, and had
understood it; and, like Sir Guyon, he felt himself to be a knight
enrolled under the banner of Parity and Self-Control. So that, in
<i>Comus</i>, we find the sovereign value of Temperance or
Self-Regulation&mdash;what the Greeks called
<span class="translit" title="sôphrosynê">&#963;&#969;&#966;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#8059;&#957;&#951;</span>&mdash;set
forth no less <a class="pagebreak" name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi"
title="xi"></a>clearly than in Spenser&rsquo;s poem: in Milton&rsquo;s
mask it becomes almost identical with Virtue itself. The enchantments
of Acrasia in her Bower of Bliss become the spells of Comus; the
armour of Belphoebe becomes the &ldquo;complete steel&rdquo; of
Chastity; while the supremacy of Conscience, the bounty of Nature and
man&rsquo;s ingratitude, the unloveliness of Mammon and of Excess, the
blossom of Courtesy oft found on lowly stalk, and the final triumph of
Virtue through striving and temptation, all are dwelt upon.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It is the mind that maketh good or ill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That maketh wretch or happie, rich or poore:<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>so speaks Spenser; and Milton similarly&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He that has light within his own clear breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May sit i&rsquo; the centre, and enjoy bright day:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he that hides a dark soul and foul thoughts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Benighted walks under the mid-day sun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Himself is his own dungeon.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In endeavouring still further to trace, by means of verbal or
structural resemblances, the sources from which Milton drew his
materials for <i>Comus</i>, critics have referred to Peele&rsquo;s
<i>Old Wives&rsquo; Tale</i> (1595); to Fletcher&rsquo;s pastoral,
<i>The Faithful Shepherdess</i>, of which Charles Lamb has said that
if all its parts &lsquo;had been in unison with its many innocent
scenes and sweet lyric intermixtures, it had been a poem fit to vie
with <i>Comus</i> or the <i>Arcadia</i>, to have been put into the
hands of boys and virgins, to have made matter for young dreams, like
the loves of Hermia and Lysander&rsquo;; to Ben Jonson&rsquo;s mask of
<i>Pleasure reconciled to Virtue</i> (1619), in which Comus is
&ldquo;the god of cheer, or the Belly&rdquo;; and to the <i>Comus</i>
of <a class="pagebreak" name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii" title="xii"></a>
Erycius Puteanus (Henri du Puy), Professor of Eloquence at Louvain. It
is true that Fletcher&rsquo;s pastoral was being acted in London about
the time Milton was writing his <i>Comus</i>, that the poem by the
Dutch Professor was republished at Oxford in 1634, and that
resemblances are evident between Milton&rsquo;s poem and those named.
But Professor Masson does well in warning us that &ldquo;infinitely
too much has been made of such coincidences. After all of them, even
the most ideal and poetical, the feeling in reading <i>Comus</i> is
that all here is different, all peculiar.&rdquo; Whatever Milton
borrowed, he borrowed, as he says himself, in order to better it.</p>

<p>It is interesting to consider the mutual relations of the poems
written by Milton at Horton. Everything that Milton wrote is Miltonic;
he had what has been called the power of transforming everything into
himself, and these poems are, accordingly, evidences of the
development of Milton&rsquo;s opinions and of his secret purpose. It
has been said that <i>L&rsquo;Allegro</i> and <i>Il Penseroso</i> are
to be regarded as &ldquo;the pleadings, the decision on which is in
Comus&rdquo;&mdash;<i>L&rsquo;Allegro</i> representing the Cavalier,
and <i>Il Penseroso</i> the Puritan element. This is true only in a
limited sense. It is true that the Puritan element in the Horton
series of poems becomes more patent as we pass from the two lyrics to
the mask of <i>Comus</i>, and from <i>Comus</i> to the elegy of
<i>Lycidas</i>, just as, in the corresponding periods of time, the
evils connected with the reign of Charles I. and with Laud&rsquo;s
crusade against Puritanism were becoming more pronounced. But we can
hardly regard Milton as having expressed any new decision in
<i>Comus</i>: the decision is already made
<a class="pagebreak" name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii" title="xiii"></a>
when &ldquo;vain deluding Joys&rdquo; are banished in <i>Il
Penseroso</i>, and &ldquo;loathed Melancholy&rdquo; in
<i>L&rsquo;Allegro</i>. The mask is an expansion and exaltation of the
delights of the contemplative man, but there is still a place for the
&ldquo;unreproved pleasures&rdquo; of the cheerful man. Unless it were
so, <i>Comus</i> could not have been written; there would have been no
&ldquo;sunshine holiday&rdquo; for the rustics and no
&ldquo;victorious dance&rdquo; for the gentle lady and her brothers.
But in <i>Comus</i> we realise the mutual relation of
<i>L&rsquo;Allegro</i> and <i>Il Penseroso</i>; we see their
application to the joys and sorrows of the actual life of individuals;
we observe human nature in contact with the &ldquo;hard assays&rdquo;
of life. And, subsequently, in <i>Lycidas</i> we are made to realise
that this human nature is Milton&rsquo;s own, and to understand how it
was that his Puritanism which, three years before, had permitted him
to write a cavalier mask, should, three years after, lead him from the
fresh fields of poetry into the barren plains of controversial
prose.</p>

<p>The Mask was a favourite form of entertainment in England in
Milton&rsquo;s youth, and had been so from the time of Henry VIII., in
whose reign elaborate masked shows, introduced from Italy, first
became popular. But they seem to have found their way into England, in
a crude form, even earlier; and we read of court disguisings in the
reign of Edward III. It is usually said that the Mask derives its name
from the fact that the actors wore masks, and in Hall&rsquo;s
Chronicle we read that, in 1512, &ldquo;on the day of Epiphany at
night, the king, with eleven others, was disguised after the manner of
Italy, called a Mask, a thing not seen before in England; they were
appareled in garments long and broad, wrought
<a class="pagebreak" name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv" title="xiv"></a>
all with gold, with <i>visors</i> and caps of gold.&rdquo; The truth,
however, seems to be that the use of a visor was not essential in such
entertainments, which, from the first, were called
&lsquo;masks,&rsquo; the word &lsquo;masker&rsquo; being used
sometimes of the players, and sometimes of their disguises. The word
has come to us, through the French form <i>masque</i>, cognate with
Spanish <i>mascarada</i>, a masquerade or assembly of maskers,
otherwise called a mummery. Up to the time of Henry VIII. these
entertainments were of the nature of dumb-show or <i>tableaux
vivants</i>, and delighted the spectators chiefly by the splendour of
the costumes and machinery employed in their representation; but,
afterwards, the chief actors spoke their parts, singing and dancing
were introduced, and the composition of masks for royal and other
courtly patrons became an occupation worthy of a poet. They were
frequently combined with other forms of amusement, all of which were,
in the case of the Court, placed under the management of a Master of
Revels, whose official title was Magister Jocorum, Revellorum et
<i>Mascorum</i>; in the first printed English tragedy, <i>Gorboduc</i>
(1565), each act opens with what is called a dumb-show or mask. But
the more elaborate form of the Mask soon grew to be an entertainment
complete in itself, and the demand for such became so great in the
time of James I. and Charles I. that the history of these reigns might
almost be traced in the succession of masks then written. Ben Jonson,
who thoroughly established the Mask in English literature, wrote many
Court Masks, and made them a vehicle less for the display of
&lsquo;painting and carpentry&rsquo; than for the expression of the
intellectual and social life of his time. His masks are
<a class="pagebreak" name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv" title="xv"></a>
excelled only by <i>Comus</i>, and possess in a high degree that
&lsquo;Doric delicacy&rsquo; in their songs and odes which Sir Henry
Wotton found so ravishing in Milton&rsquo;s mask. Jonson, in his
lifetime, declared that, next himself, only Fletcher and Chapman could
write a mask; and apart from the compositions of these writers and of
William Browne (<i>Inner Temple Masque</i>), there are few specimens
worthy to be named along with Jonson&rsquo;s until we come to
Milton&rsquo;s <i>Arcades</i>. Other mask-writers were Middleton,
Dekker, Shirley, Carew, and Davenant; and it is interesting to note
that in Carew&rsquo;s <i>Coelum Brittanicum</i> (1633-4), for which
Lawes composed the music, the two boys who afterwards acted in
<i>Comus</i> had juvenile parts. It has been pointed out that the
popularity of the Mask in Milton&rsquo;s youth received a stimulus
from the Puritan hatred of the theatre which found expression at that
time, and drove non-Puritans to welcome the Mask as a protest against
that spirit which saw nothing but evil in every form of dramatic
entertainment. Milton, who enjoyed the theatre&mdash;both
&ldquo;Jonson&rsquo;s learned sock&rdquo; and what &ldquo;ennobled
hath the buskined stage&rdquo;&mdash;was led, through his friendship
with the musician Lawes, to compose a mask to celebrate the entry of
the Earl of Bridgewater upon his office of &ldquo;Lord President of
the Council in the Principality of Wales and the Marches of the
same.&rdquo; He had already written, also at the request of Lawes, a
mask, or portion of a mask, called <i>Arcades</i>, and the success of
this may have stimulated him to higher effort. The result was
<i>Comus</i>, in which the Mask reached its highest level, and after
which it practically faded out of our literature.</p>

<p>Milton&rsquo;s two masks, <i>Arcades</i> and <i>Comus</i>, were written
<a class="pagebreak" name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi" title="xvi"></a>
for members of the same noble family, the former in honour of the
Countess Dowager of Derby, and the latter in honour of John, first
Earl of Bridgewater, who was both her stepson and son-in-law. This
two-fold relation arose from the fact that the Earl was the son of
Viscount Brackley, the Countess&rsquo;s second husband, and had
himself married Lady Frances Stanley, a daughter of the Countess by
her first husband, the fifth Earl of Derby. Amongst the children of
the Earl of Bridgewater were three who took important parts in the
representation of <i>Comus</i>&mdash;Alice, the youngest daughter,
then about fourteen years of age, who appeared as <i>The Lady</i>;
John, Viscount Brackley, who took the part of the <i>Elder
Brother</i>, and Thomas Egerton, who appeared as the <i>Second
Brother</i>. We do not know who acted the parts of <i>Comus</i> and
<i>Sabrina</i>, but the part of the <i>Attendant Spirit</i> was taken
by Henry Lawes, &ldquo;gentleman of the Chapel Royal, and one of His
Majesty&rsquo;s private musicians.&rdquo; The Earl&rsquo;s children
were his pupils, and the mask was naturally produced under his
direction. Milton&rsquo;s friendship with Lawes is shown by the sonnet
which the poet addressed to the musician:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Harry, whose tuneful and well measur&rsquo;d song<br /></span>
<span class="i1">First taught our English music how to span<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Words with just note and accent, not to scan<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With Midas&rsquo; ears, committing short and long;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy worth and skill exempts thee from the throng,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With praise enough for Envy to look wan;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To after age thou shalt be writ the man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That with smooth air could&rsquo;st humour best our tongue.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou honour&rsquo;st Verse, and Verse must lend her wing<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To honour thee, the priest of Phoebus&rsquo; quire,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That tun&rsquo;st their happiest lines in hymn, or story.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><a class="pagebreak" name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii" title="xvii"></a>Dante shall give Fame leave to set thee higher<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Than his Casella, who he woo&rsquo;d to sing,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Met in the milder shades of Purgatory.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We must remember also that it was to Lawes that Milton&rsquo;s
<i>Comus</i> owed its first publication, and, as we see from the
dedication prefixed to the text, that he was justly proud of his share
in its first representation.</p>

<p>Such were the persons who appeared in Milton&rsquo;s mask; they are
few in number, and the plan of the piece is correspondingly simple.
There are three scenes which may be briefly characterised thus:</p>

<div class="center">
<table summary="Outline of scenes">

    <td class="toright">I.</td>
    <td>The Tempter and the Tempted: lines

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td class="indent3"><i>Scene</i>: The Palace of Comus.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td class="indent3"><i>Scene</i>: The President&rsquo;s
      Castle.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>In the first scene, after a kind of prologue (lines 1-92), the
interest rises as we are introduced first to Comus and his rout, then
to the Lady alone and &ldquo;night-foundered,&rdquo; and finally to
Comus and the Lady in company. At the same time the nature of the
Lady&rsquo;s trial and her subsequent victory are foreshadowed in a
conversation between the brothers and the attendant Spirit. This is
one of the more Miltonic parts of the mask: in the philosophical
reasoning of the elder brother, as opposed to the matter-of-fact
arguments of the younger, we trace the young poet fresh from the study
of the divine volume of Plato, and filled with a noble trust in God.
In the second scene we breathe the unhallowed air of the abode of the
wily
<a class="pagebreak" name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii"
title="xviii"></a>
tempter, who endeavours, &ldquo;under fair pretence of friendly
ends,&rdquo; to wind himself into the pure heart of the Lady. But his
&ldquo;gay rhetoric&rdquo; is futile against the &ldquo;sun-clad power
of chastity&rdquo;; and he is driven off the scene by the two
brothers, who are led and instructed by the Spirit disguised as the
shepherd Thyrsis. But the Lady, having been lured into the haunt of
impurity, is left spell-bound, and appeal is made to the pure nymph
Sabrina, who is &ldquo;swift to aid a virgin, such as was herself, in
hard-besetting need.&rdquo; It is in the contention between Comus and
the Lady in this scene that the interest of the mask may be said to
culminate, for here its purpose stands revealed: &ldquo;it is a song
to Temperance as the ground of Freedom, to temperance as the guard of
all the virtues, to beauty as secured by temperance, and its central
point and climax is in the pleading of these motives by the Lady
against their opposites in the mouth of the Lord of sensual
Revel.&rdquo; <i>Milton: Classical Writers</i>. In the third scene the
Lady Alice and her brothers are presented by the Spirit to their noble
father and mother as triumphing &ldquo;in victorious dance o&rsquo;er
sensual folly and intemperance.&rdquo; The Spirit then speaks the
epilogue, calling upon mortals who love true freedom to strive after
virtue:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Love Virtue; she alone is free.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She can teach ye how to climb<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Higher than the sphery chime;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, if Virtue feeble were,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heaven itself would stoop to her.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The last couplet Milton afterwards, on his Italian journey, entered in
an album belonging to an Italian named Cerdogni, and underneath it the
words, <i>Coelum
<a class="pagebreak" name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix" title="xix"></a>
non animum muto dum trans mare curro</i>, and his signature, Joannes
Miltonius, Anglus. The juxtaposition of these verses is significant:
though he had left his own land Milton had not become what, fifty or
sixty years before, Roger Ascham had condemned as an
&ldquo;Italianated Englishman.&rdquo; He was one of those
&ldquo;worthy Gentlemen of England, whom all the Siren tongues of
Italy could never untwine from the mast of God&rsquo;s word; nor no
enchantment of vanity overturn them from the fear of God and love of
honesty&rdquo; (Ascham&rsquo;s <i>Scholemaster</i>). And one might
almost infer that Milton, in his account of the sovereign plant
Haemony which was to foil the wiles of <i>Comus</i>, had remembered
not only Homer&rsquo;s description of the root Moly &ldquo;that Hermes
once to wise Ulysses
gave,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_16-A_1" id="FNanchor_16-A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_16-A_1" class="fnnum">16:A</a>
but also Ascham&rsquo;s remarks thereupon: &ldquo;The true medicine
against the enchantments of Circe, the vanity of licentious pleasure,
the enticements of all sin, is, in Homer, the herb Moly, with the
black root and white flower, sour at first, but sweet in the end;
which Hesiod termeth the study of Virtue, hard and irksome in the
beginning, but in the end easy and pleasant. And that which is most to
be marvelled at, the divine poet Homer saith plainly that this
medicine against sin and vanity is
<a class="pagebreak" name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx" title="xx"></a>
not found out by man, but given and taught by God.&rdquo;
Milton&rsquo;s <i>Comus</i>, like his last great poems, is a poetical
expression of the same belief. &ldquo;His poetical works, the outcome
of his inner life, his life of artistic contemplation, are,&rdquo; in
the words of Prof. Dowden, &ldquo;various renderings of one dominant
idea&mdash;that the struggle for mastery between good and evil is the
prime fact of life; and that a final victory of the righteous cause is
assured by the existence of a divine order of the universe, which
Milton knew by the name of &lsquo;Providence.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_16-A_1" id="Footnote_16-A_1"></a>
<span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_16-A_1">16:A</a></span>
It is noteworthy that Lamb, whose allusiveness is remarkable, employs
in his account of the plant Moly almost the exact words of
Milton&rsquo;s description of Haemony; compare the following extract
from <i>The Adventures of Ulysses</i> with lines 629-640 of
<i>Comus</i>: &ldquo;The flower of the herb Moly, which is sovereign
against enchantments: the moly is a small unsightly root, its virtues
but little known, and in low estimation; the dull shepherd treads on
it every day with his clouted shoes, but it bears a small white
flower, which is medicinal against charms, blights, mildews, and
damps.&rdquo;</p>

<i>The Copy of a Letter written by Sir Henry Wotton to the Author upon the
following Poem.</i></p>


<p class='toright'>
From the College, this 13 of April, 1638.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,
</p>

<p>It was a special favour, when you lately bestowed upon me here the first
taste of your acquaintance, though no longer than to make me know that I
wanted more time to value it, and to enjoy it rightly; and, in truth, if
I could then have imagined your farther stay in these parts, which I
understood afterwards by Mr. H., I would have been bold, in our vulgar
phrase, to mend my draught (for you left me with an extreme thirst), and
to have begged your conversation again, jointly with your said learned
friend, at a poor meal or two, that we might have banded together some
good authors of the antient time; among which I observed you to have
been familiar.</p>

<p>Since your going, you have charged me with new obligations, both for a
very kind letter from you dated the sixth of this month, and for a
dainty piece of entertainment which came therewith. Wherein I should
much commend the tragical part, if the lyrical did not ravish me with a
certain Doric delicacy in your songs and odes, whereunto I must plainly
confess to have seen yet nothing parallel in our language: <i>Ipsa
mollities</i>.<a name="FNanchor_19-A_2" id="FNanchor_19-A_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_19-A_2" class="fnnum">19:A</a>
But I must not omit to tell you, that I now only owe you thanks for
<a class="pagebreak" name="Page_3" id="Page_3" title="3"></a>
intimating unto me (how modestly soever) the true
artificer. For the work itself I had viewed some good while before, with
singular delight, having received it from our common friend Mr. R. in
the very close of the late R.&rsquo;s poems, printed at Oxford; whereunto it
is added (as I now suppose) that the accessory might help out the
principal, according to the art of stationers, and to leave the reader
<i>con la bocca dolce</i>.<a name="FNanchor_20-A_3" id="FNanchor_20-A_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_20-A_3" class="fnnum">20:A</a></p>

<p>Now, Sir, concerning your travels, wherein I may challenge a little more
privilege of discourse with you; I suppose you will not blanch<a name="FNanchor_20-B_4" id="FNanchor_20-B_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_20-B_4" class="fnnum">20:B</a>
Paris in your way; therefore I have been bold to trouble you with a few
lines to Mr. M. B., whom you shall easily find attending the young Lord
S. as his governor, and you may surely receive from him good directions
for shaping of your farther journey into Italy, where he did reside by
my choice some time for the king, after mine own recess from Venice.</p>

<p>I should think that your best line will be through the whole length of
France to Marseilles, and thence by sea to Genoa, whence the passage
into Tuscany is as diurnal as a Gravesend barge. I hasten, as you do, to
Florence, or Siena, the rather to tell you a short story, from the
interest you have given me in your safety.</p>

<p>At Siena I was tabled in the house of one Alberto Scipione, an old Roman
courtier in dangerous times, having been steward to the Duca di
Pagliano, who with all his family were strangled, save this only man,
that escaped by foresight of the tempest. With him I had often much chat
of those affairs; into which he took pleasure to look back from his
native harbour; and at my departure toward Rome (which had been the
centre of his experience) I had won confidence enough to beg his advice,
how I might carry myself securely there, without offence of others, or
<a class="pagebreak" name="Page_4" id="Page_4" title="4"></a>
of mine own conscience. <i>Signor Arrigo mio</i> (says he), <i>I pensieri
stretti, ed il viso
sciolto</i>,<a name="FNanchor_21-A_5" id="FNanchor_21-A_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_21-A_5" class="fnnum">21:A</a>
will go safely over the whole world.
Of which Delphian oracle (for so I have found it) your judgment doth
need no commentary; and therefore, Sir, I will commit you with it to the
best of all securities, God&rsquo;s dear love, remaining</p>

<p class='center'>
Your friend as much to command<br />
as any of longer date,</p>

<p class='toright'>HENRY WOTTON.
</p>

<p class='center gaplet'><i>Postscript.</i></p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;I have expressly sent this my footboy to prevent your departure
without some acknowledgment from me of the receipt of your obliging
letter, having myself through some business, I know not how, neglected
the ordinary conveyance. In any part where I shall understand you fixed,
I shall be glad and diligent to entertain you with home-novelties, even
for some fomentation of our friendship, too soon interrupted in the
cradle.<a name="FNanchor_21-B_6" id="FNanchor_21-B_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_21-B_6" class="fnnum">21:B</a></p>

This letter was printed in the edition of 1645, but
omitted in that of 1673. It was written by Sir Henry Wotton, Provost of
Eton College, just in time to overtake Milton before he set out on his
journey to Italy. As a parting act of courtesy Milton had sent Sir Henry
a letter with a copy of Lawes&rsquo;s edition of his <i>Comus</i>,
and the above letter is an acknowledgment of the favour.

<p>This Poem, which received its first occasion of birth from yourself and
others of your noble family, and much honour from your own person in the
performance, now returns again to make a final Dedication of itself to
you. Although not openly acknowledged by the Author, yet it is a
legitimate offspring, so lovely and so much desired that the often
copying of it hath tired my pen to give my several friends satisfaction,
and brought me to a necessity of producing it to the public view; and
now to offer it up, in all rightful devotion, to those fair hopes and
rare endowments of your much-promising youth, which give a full
assurance to all that know you, of a future excellence. Live, sweet
Lord, to be the honour of your name, and receive this as your own, from
the hands of him who hath by many favours been long obliged to your most

Spirit descends</b></a>. The part of the attendant spirit was taken by
Lawes (see Introduction), who, in his prologue or opening speech,
explains who he is and on what errand he has been sent, hints at the
plot of the whole masque, and at the same time compliments the Earl in
whose honour the masque is being given (lines <a
href="#line_30">30-36</a>). In the ancient classical drama the
prologue was sometimes an outline of the plot, sometimes an address to
the audience, and sometimes introductory to the plot. The opening of
<i>Comus</i> prepares the audience and also directly addresses it
(line <a href="#line_40">43</a>). For the form of the epilogue in the
actual performance of the masque see <a href="#note_974">note</a>, l.
975-6.</p>

<p><a name="note_1" id="note_1"></a>
<a href="#line_0">1.</a> <b>starry threshold</b>, etc. Comp. Virgil:
&ldquo;The sire of gods and monarch of
men summons a council to the starry chamber&rdquo; (<i>sideream in sedem</i>),
<i>Aen.</i> x. 2.</p>

<p><a name="note_2" id="note_2"></a>
<a href="#line_0">2.</a> <b>mansion</b>, abode. Trench points out that
this word denotes strictly &ldquo;a place of tarrying,&rdquo; which
might be for a longer or a shorter time: hence &lsquo;a
resting-place.&rsquo; Comp. <i>John</i>, xiv. 2, &ldquo;In my
Father&rsquo;s house are many <i>mansions</i>&rdquo;; and <i>Il
Pens.</i> 93, &ldquo;Her <i>mansion</i> in this fleshly nook.&rdquo;
The word has now lost the notion of tarrying, and is applied to a
large and important dwelling-house. <b>where</b>, in which: the
antecedent is separated from the relative, a frequent construction in
Milton (comp. lines <a href="#line_60">66</a>, <a
href="#line_820">821</a>, etc.). So in Latin, where the grammatical
connection would generally be sufficiently indicated by the
inflection. <b>shapes ... spirits</b>. An instance of the manner in
which Milton endows spiritual beings with personality without making
<a class="pagebreak" name="Page_39" id="Page_39" title="39"></a>them
too distinct. &ldquo;Of all the poets who have introduced into their
works the agency of supernatural beings Milton has succeeded
best&rdquo; (Macaulay). We see this in <i>Par. Lost</i> (<i>e.g.</i>
ii. 666). Compare the use of the word &lsquo;shape&rsquo; (Lat.
<i>umbra</i>) in l. <a href="#line_820">207</a>: also
<i>L&rsquo;Alleg.</i> 4, &ldquo;horrid <i>shapes</i> and
shrieks&rdquo;; and <i>Il Pens.</i> 6, &ldquo;fancies fond with gaudy
<i>shapes</i> possess.&rdquo; Milton&rsquo;s use of the demonstrative
<b>those</b> in this line is noteworthy; comp. &ldquo;<i>that</i> last
infirmity of noble mind,&rdquo; <i>Lyc.</i> 71: it implies that the
reference is to something well known, and that further
particularisation is needless.</p>

<p><a name="note_3" id="note_3"></a>
<a href="#line_0">3.</a>
<b>insphered</b>. &lsquo;Sphere,&rsquo; with its derivatives
&lsquo;sphery,&rsquo; &lsquo;insphere,&rsquo; and
&lsquo;unsphere&rsquo; (<i>Il Pens.</i> 88), is used by Milton with a
literal reference to the cosmical framework as a whole (see <i>Hymn
Nat.</i> 48) or to some portion of it. In Shakespeare
&lsquo;sphere&rsquo; occurs in the wider sense of &lsquo;the path in
which anything moves,&rsquo; and it is to this metaphorical use of the
word that we owe such phrases as &lsquo;a person&rsquo;s sphere of
life,&rsquo; &lsquo;sphere of action,&rsquo; etc. See also
<i>Comus</i>, 112-4, 241-3, 1021; <i>Arc.</i> 62-7; <i>Par. Lost</i>,
v. 618; where there are references to the music of the spheres.</p>

<p><a name="note_4" id="note_4"></a><a href="#line_0">4.</a>
<b>mild</b>: an attributive of the whole clause, &lsquo;regions of
calm and serene air.&rsquo; <b>calm and serene</b>. These are not mere
synonyms: the Lat. <i>serenus</i> = bright or unclouded, so that the
two epithets are to be respectively contrasted with
&lsquo;smoke&rsquo; and &lsquo;stir&rsquo; (line <a
href="#line_0">5</a>); &lsquo;calm&rsquo; being opposed to
&lsquo;stir&rsquo; and &lsquo;serene&rsquo; to &lsquo;smoke.&rsquo;
Compare Homer&rsquo;s description of the seat of the gods: &ldquo;Not
by wind is it shaken, nor ever wet with rain, nor doth the snow come
nigh thereto, but <i>most clear</i> air is spread about it
<i>cloudless</i>, and the white light floats over it,&rdquo;

<p><a name="note_5" id="note_5"></a><a href="#line_0">5.</a>
<b>this dim spot</b>. The Spirit describes the Earth as it appears to those
immortal shapes whose presence he has just quitted.</p>

<p><a name="note_6" id="note_6"></a><a href="#line_0">6.</a>
There are here two attributive clauses: &ldquo;which men call
Earth&rdquo; and &ldquo;(in which) men strive,&rdquo; etc.
<b>low-thoughted care</b>; narrow-minded anxiety, care about earthly
things. Comp. the form of the adjective &lsquo;low-browed,&rsquo;
<i>L&rsquo;Alleg.</i> 8: both epithets are borrowed by Pope in his
<i>Eloisa</i>.</p>

<p><a name="note_7" id="note_7"></a><a href="#line_0">7.</a>
This line is attributive to &lsquo;men.&rsquo; <b>pestered ...
pinfold</b>, crowded together in this cramped space, the Earth.
<i>Pester</i>, which has no connection with <i>pest</i>, is a
shortened form of <i>impester</i>, Fr. <i>emp&ecirc;trer</i>, to
shackle a horse by the foot when it is at pasture. The radical sense
is that of clogging (comp. <i>Son.</i> xii. 1); hence of crowding; and
finally of annoyance or encumbrance of any kind. &lsquo;Pinfold&rsquo;
is strictly an enclosure in which stray cattle are <i>pounded</i> or
shut up: etymologically, the word = <i>pind-fold</i>, a corruption of
<i>pound-fold</i>. Comp. <i>impound</i>, sheep-<i>fold</i>, etc.</p>

<p><a name="note_8" id="note_8"></a><a href="#line_0">8.</a>
<b>frail and feverish</b>. Comp. &ldquo;life&rsquo;s fitful

<b>this mortal change</b>. In Milton&rsquo;s <span
class="smcap">MS.</span> line 7 was followed by the words,
&lsquo;beyond the written date of mortal change,&rsquo; <i>i.e.</i>
beyond, or after, man&rsquo;s appointed time to die. These words were
struck out, but we may suppose that the words &lsquo;mortal
change&rsquo; in line <a href="#line_10">10</a> have a similar
meaning. Milton frequently uses &lsquo;mortal&rsquo; in the sense of
&lsquo;liable to death,&rsquo; and hence &lsquo;human&rsquo; as
opposed to &lsquo;divine&rsquo;: the mortal change is therefore
&lsquo;the change which occurs to all human beings.&rsquo; Comp.

the universe was distributed amongst his three sons, Jupiter

drew a domain of his own, and to me fell the hoary sea, to be my

<p>Some would take the word as strictly denoting division into

into four separate governments: for besides those at London and
Edinburgh, there were Lords President of the North and of
Wales.&rdquo; (Keightley). <b>blue-haired deities</b>. These must be

with the complimentary nature of lines <a href="#line_30">30-36</a>.
Regarding the epithet &lsquo;blue-haired&rsquo; Masson asks:
&ldquo;Can there be a recollection of blue as the British colour,
inherited from the old times of blue-stained Britons who fought with
Caesar? Green-haired is the usual epithet for Neptune and his
subordinates&rdquo;: in Spenser, for example, the sea-nymphs have long
green hair. But Ovid expressly calls the sea-deities <i>caerulei
dii</i>, and Neptune <i>caeruleus deus</i>, thus associating blue with
the sea.</p>

&lsquo;And all this region that looks towards the West (<i>i.e.</i> Wales) is
entrusted to a noble peer of great integrity and power.&rsquo; The peer
referred to is the Earl of Bridgewater. As Lord President he was
entrusted with the civil and military administration of Wales and the
four English counties of Gloucester, Worcester, Hereford, and
Shropshire. That he was a nobleman of high character is shown by the
fact that from 1617, when he was nominated one of &ldquo;his Majestie&rsquo;s
Counsellors,&rdquo; he had continued to serve in various important public and
private offices. On his monument there is the following: &ldquo;He was a
profound Scholar, an able Statesman, and a good Christian: he was a
dutiful Son

<p>That they were haughty and &lsquo;proud in arms&rsquo; the Romans
found, and after them the Saxons: the latter never really held more
than the counties of Monmouth and Hereford. In the reign of Edward I.
attempts were made by that king to induce the Welsh to come to terms,
but the answer of the Barons was: &ldquo;We dare not submit to Edward,
nor will we suffer our prince to do so, nor do homage to strangers,
whose tongue, ways and laws we know not of: we have only raised war in
defence of our lands, laws and rights.&rdquo; By a statute of Henry
VIII. this &lsquo;haughty&rsquo; people were put in possession of the
same rights and liberties as the English. <b>proud in arms</b>: this

we may regard it as governing the substantive clause, &lsquo;that ...
guard.&rsquo; <b>quick command</b>: the adjective has the force of an
adverb, quick commands being commands that are to be carried quickly.
<b>sovran</b>, supreme. This is Milton&rsquo;s spelling of the modern
word <i>sovereign</i>, in which the <i>g</i> is due to the mistaken
notion that the last syllable of the word is cognate with

<b>And listen why</b>; <i>sc.</i> &lsquo;I was despatched.&rsquo; The
language of lines <a href="#line_40">43, 44</a> is suggested by
Horace&rsquo;s <i>Odes</i>, iii. 1, 2: &ldquo;Favete linguis; carmina
non prius Audita ... canto.&rdquo; The poet implies that the plot of
his mask is original: it is not (he says) to be found in any ancient
or modern song or tale that was ever recited either in the
&lsquo;hall&rsquo; (= banqueting-hall) or in the &lsquo;bower&rsquo;
(= private chamber). Or &lsquo;hall&rsquo; and &lsquo;bower&rsquo; may
denote respectively the room of the lord and that of his lady.</p>

<p><a name="note_46" id="note_46"></a><a href="#line_40">46.</a>
Milton in his usual significant manner (comp. <i>L&rsquo;Allegro</i> and <i>Il
Penseroso</i>), proceeds to invent a genealogy for Comus. The mask is
designed to celebrate the victory of Purity and Reason over Desire and
Enchantment. Comus, who represents the latter, must therefore spring
from parents representing the pleasure of man&rsquo;s lower nature and the
misuse of man&rsquo;s higher powers on behalf of falsehood and impurity. These
parents are the wine-god Bacchus and the sorceress Circe. The former,
mated with Love, is the father of Mirth (see <i>L&rsquo;Allegro</i>);
but, mated
with the cunning Circe, his offspring is a voluptuary
<a class="pagebreak" name="Page_45" id="Page_45" title="45"></a>
whose gay exterior and flattering speech hide his dangerously
seductive and magical powers. He bears no resemblance, therefore, to
Comus as represented in Ben Jonson&rsquo;s <i>Pleasure reconciled to
Virtue</i>, in which mask &ldquo;Comus&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
Belly&rdquo; are throughout synonymous. In the <i>Agamemnon</i> of
Aeschylus, Comus is a &ldquo;drinker of human blood&rdquo;; in
Philostratus, he is a rose-crowned wine-bibber; in Dekker he is
&ldquo;the clerk of gluttony&rsquo;s kitchen&rdquo;; in Massinger he
is &ldquo;the god of pleasure&rdquo;; and in the work of Erycius
Puteanus he is a graceful reveller, the genius of love and
cheerfulness. Prof. Masson says, &ldquo;Milton&rsquo;s <i>Comus</i> is
a creation of his own, for which he was as little indebted
intrinsically to Puteanus as to Ben Jonson. For the purpose of his
masque at Ludlow Castle he was bold enough to add a brand-new god, no
less, to the classic Pantheon, and to import him into Britain.&rdquo;
<b>Bacchus</b>, the god who taught men the preparation of wine. He is
the Greek Dionysus, who, on one of his voyages, hired a vessel
belonging to some Tyrrhenian pirates: these men resolved to sell him
as a slave. Thereupon, he changed the mast and oars of the ship into
serpents and the sailors into dolphins. The meeting of Bacchus with
Circe is Milton&rsquo;s own invention; in the <i>Odyssey</i> it is
Ulysses who lights upon her island: &ldquo;And we came to the isle
&AElig;&aelig;an, where dwelt Circe of the braided tresses, an awful
goddess of mortal speech, own sister to the wizard &AElig;etes,&rdquo;

<b>After the Tuscan mariners transformed</b>, <i>i.e.</i> after the
transformation of the Tuscan mariners (see Ovid, <i>Met.</i> iii.).
They are called Tuscan, because Tyrrhenia in Central Italy was named
Etruria or Tuscia by the Romans: Etruria includes modern Tuscany. This
grammatical construction is common in Latin; a passive participle
combined with a substantive answering to an English verbal or abstract
noun connected with another noun by the preposition <i>of</i>, and
used to denote a fact in the past; <i>e.g.</i> &ldquo;since created
man&rdquo; (<i>P. L.</i> i. 573) = since the creation of man:
&ldquo;this loss recovered&rdquo; (<i>P. L.</i> ii. 21) = the recovery

older English, generally used impersonally, and in Chaucer we find
&lsquo;if thee lust&rsquo; or &lsquo;if thee list&rsquo; = if it
please thee. The word survives in the adjective <i>listless</i> of
which the older form was <i>lustless</i>: the noun <i>lust</i> has
lost its original and wider sense (which it still has in German), and
now signifies &lsquo;longing desire.&rsquo;</p>

(followers of Ulysses) in and set them upon chairs and high seats, and
made them a mess of cheese and barley-meal and yellow honey with
Pramnian wine, and mixed harmful drugs with the food to make them
utterly forget their own country. Now when she had given them the cup
and they had drunk it off, presently she smote them with a wand, and
in the styes of the swine she penned them. So they had the head and
voice, the bristles and the shape of swine, but their mind abode even
as of old. Thus were they penned there weeping, and Circe flung them
acorns and mast and fruit of the cornel tree to eat, whereon wallowing
swine do always batten.&rdquo; (<i>Butcher and Lang&rsquo;s

<span class="translit" title="kômos">&#954;&#8182;&#956;&#959;&#962;</span>
denoted a
revel or merry-making; afterwards it came to mean the personification of
riotous mirth, the god of Revel. Hence also the word <i>comedy</i>. In
classical mythology the individuality of Comus is not well defined: this
enabled Milton more readily to endow him with entirely new
characteristics.</p>

&ldquo;a frolic welcome.&rdquo; It is now chiefly used as a noun or a
verb, and a new adjective, <i>frolicsome</i>, has taken its place;
from this, again, comes the noun <i>frolicsomeness</i>. <i>Frolic</i>
is from the Dutch, and cognate with German <i>fr&ouml;hlich</i>, so
that <i>lic</i> in &lsquo;frolic&rsquo; corresponds to <i>ly</i> in
such words as cleanly, godly, etc. <b>of</b>: this use of the
preposition may be compared with the Latin genitive in such phrases as
<i>&aelig;ger animi</i> = sick of soul; of = &lsquo;because of&rsquo;
or &lsquo;in respect of.&rsquo;</p>

observes, this suited the convenience of the performers who were to
appear on the stage in masks (see <i>Stage direction</i>, l. <a
href="#line_90">92-3</a>). Grammatically, line <a
href="#line_70">72</a> is an example of the absolute construction,
common in Latin. The noun (&lsquo;parts&rsquo;) is neither the subject
nor the object of a verb, but is used along with some attributive
adjunct&mdash;generally a participle
(&lsquo;remaining&rsquo;)&mdash;to serve the purpose of an adverb or
adverbial clause. The noun (or pronoun) is usually said to be the
nominative absolute; but, in the case of pronouns, Milton uses the
nominative and the objective indifferently. In Old English the dative
was used.</p>

whosoever of them did eat the honey-sweet fruit of the lotus had no
more wish to bring tidings nor to come back, but there he chose to
abide with the lotus-eating men, ever feeding on the lotus and
forgetful of his homeward way.&rdquo; In Tennyson&rsquo;s
<i>Lotos-Eaters</i> there is no forgetfulness of friends and home:
&ldquo;Sweet it was to dream of Fatherland, Of child, and wife and
slave.&rdquo; Masson also refers to Plato&rsquo;s ethical application
of the story (<i>Rep.</i> viii.); &ldquo;Plato speaks of the moral
lotophagus, or youth steeped in sensuality, as accounting his very
viciousness a developed manhood, and the so-called virtues but signs
of rusticity.&rdquo; Compare also Spenser, <i>F. Q.</i> ii. 12. 86,

&lsquo;rout&rsquo; is the breaking up of a crowd, or a crowd broken

<b>his glowing axle doth allay</b>. In the <i>Hymn of the Nativity</i>
Milton alludes to the &ldquo;burning axle-tree&rdquo; of the sun:
comp. <i>Aen.</i> iv. 482, &ldquo;Atlas <i>Axem</i> umero
torquet.&rdquo; There is here an allusion to the opinion of the
ancients that the setting of the sun in the Atlantic Ocean was
accompanied with a noise, as of the sea hissing (Todd).
&lsquo;Allay&rsquo; would thus denote &lsquo;quench&rsquo; or
&lsquo;cool.&rsquo; <i>His</i>, in this line, = <i>its</i>. <i>Its</i>
occurs only three times in Milton&rsquo;s poems, <i>Od. Nat.</i> 106;
<i>Par. Lost</i>, i. 254; <i>Par. Lost</i>, iv. 813: the word is found
also in Lawes&rsquo; dedication of <i>Comus</i>. The word does not
occur in English at all until the end of the sixteenth century, the
possessive case of the neuter pronoun <i>it</i> and of the masculine
<i>he</i> being <i>his</i>. This gave rise to confusion when the old
gender system decayed, and the form <i>its</i> gradually came into
use, until, by the end of the seventeenth century, it was in general
use. Milton, however, scarcely recognised it, its place in his
involved syntax being taken by the relative pronouns and other
connectives, or by <i>his</i>, <i>her</i>, <i>thereof</i>, etc.</p>

The spirit of lines <a href="#line_100">102-144</a> may be contrasted
with that of <i>L&rsquo;Allegro</i>, 25-40. Both pieces are calls upon
Mirth and Pleasure, and both are therefore suitably expressed in the
same tripping
<a class="pagebreak" name="Page_51" id="Page_51" title="51"></a>
measure and with many similarities of language. But the
pleasures of <i>L&rsquo;Allegro</i> begin with the sun-rise and yet
are &ldquo;unreproved&rdquo;; those of <i>Comus</i> and his crew begin
with the darkness and are &ldquo;unreproved&rdquo; only if
&ldquo;these dun shades will ne&rsquo;er report&rdquo; them. The
&ldquo;light fantastic toe&rdquo; of the one is not the &ldquo;tipsy
dance&rdquo; of the other; and the laughter and liberty that betoken
the absence of &ldquo;wrinkled Care&rdquo; have nothing in common with
the &ldquo;midnight shout and revelry&rdquo; that can be enjoyed only
when Rigour, Advice, strict Age, and sour Severity have &ldquo;gone to
bed.&rdquo; The &ldquo;quips and cranks&rdquo; of
<i>L&rsquo;Allegro</i> have given way to the magic rites of
<i>Comus</i>, and the wreathed smiles and dimples that adorn the face
of innocent Mirth are ill replaced by the wine-dropping &ldquo;rosy

<b>pert</b>, lively. Here used in its radical sense (being a form of
<i>perk</i>, smart): its modern sense is &lsquo;forward&rsquo; or
&lsquo;impertinent.&rsquo; Skeat points out that <i>perk</i> and
<i>pert</i> were both used as verbs; <i>e.g.</i> &ldquo;<i>perked</i>

<b>wakes</b>, night-watches (A.S. <i>niht-wacu</i>, a night wake). The
adjective <i>wakeful</i> (A.S. <i>wacol</i>) is the exact cognate of
the Latin <i>vigil</i>. The word was applied to the vigil kept at the
dedication of a church, then to the feast connected therewith, and
finally to an evening merry-making. <b>prove</b>, test, judge of (Lat.
<i>probare</i>). This is its sense in older writers and in the

&lsquo;her&rsquo; shows that &lsquo;womb&rsquo; is here used in its
strict sense, but in <i>Par. Lost</i>, i. 673, &ldquo;in his

of &ldquo;interior&rdquo;: comp. the use of Lat. <i>uterus</i>,

because it is hard as a stone (Heb. <i>eben</i>, a stone); and the

<p>Shakespeare refers to &ldquo;the tell-tale day&rdquo; (<i>R. of
L.</i> 806). In <i>Odyssey</i>, viii., we read how Helios (the sun)
kept watch and informed Vulcan of Venus&rsquo;s love for Mars.
<b>descry</b>, etc., <i>i.e.</i> make known our hidden rites.
&lsquo;Descry&rsquo; is here used in its primary sense =
<i>describe</i>: both words are from Lat. <i>describere</i>, to write
fully. In Milton and Shakespeare &lsquo;descry&rsquo; also occurs in
the sense of &lsquo;to reconnoitre.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="note_142" id="note_142"></a><a href="#line_140">142.</a>
<b>solemnity</b>, ceremony, rite. The word is from Lat. <i>sollus</i>,
complete, and <i>annus</i>, a year; &lsquo;solemn&rsquo; =
<i>solennis</i> = <i>sollennis</i>.
Hence the changes of meaning: (1) recurring at the end of a completed
year; (2) usual; (3) religious, for sacred festivals recur at stated
intervals; (4) that which is not to be lightly undertaken, <i>i.e.</i>
serious or important.</p>

<b>light fantastic round</b>: comp. <i>L&rsquo;Alleg.</i> 34,
&ldquo;Come, and trip it, as you go, On the light fantastic
toe.&rdquo; A round is a dance or &lsquo;measure&rsquo; in which the
dancers join hands, &lsquo;Fantastic&rsquo; = full of fancy,
unrestrained. So Shakespeare uses it of that which has merely been
imagined, and has not yet happened. It is now used in the sense of
grotesque. <i>Fancy</i> is a form of <i>fantasy</i> (Greek
<i>phantasia</i>).</p>

<p>At this point in the mask Comus and his rout dance a measure, after
which he again speaks, but in a different strain. The change is marked

<b>shrouds</b>, coverts, places of hiding. The word etymologically
denotes &lsquo;something cut off,&rsquo; being allied to
&lsquo;shred&rsquo;; hence a garment; and finally (as in Milton) any
covering or means of covering. Many of Latimer&rsquo;s sermons are
described as having been &ldquo;preached in The Shrouds,&rdquo; a
covered place near St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral. The modern use of the
word is restricted: comp. l. <a href="#line_310">316</a>.
<b>brakes</b>, bushes. Shakespeare has
&ldquo;hawthorn-<i>brake</i>,&rdquo; <i>M. N. D.</i> iii. l. 3, and

<b>charms ... wily trains</b>; <i>i.e.</i> spells ... cunning
allurements. <i>Charm</i> is the Lat. <i>carmen</i>, a song, also used
in the sense of &lsquo;magic verses&rsquo;; wily = full of <i>wile</i>
(etymologically the same as guile). <i>Train</i> here denotes an
artifice or snare as in &lsquo;venereal trains&rsquo; (<i>Sams.
Agon.</i> 533): &ldquo;Oh, <i>train</i> me not, sweet mermaid, with
thy note&rdquo; (<i>Com. of Errors</i>, iii. 2. 45). See Index, Globe
<i>Shakespeare</i>. Some would take &lsquo;wily trains&rsquo; as =
trains of wiles.</p>

<b>ere long</b>: <i>ere</i> has here the force of a preposition; in A.S. it was

preposition.</p>

<p><a name="note_153" id="note_153"></a><a href="#line_150">153.</a>
<b>Thus I hurl</b>, etc. &ldquo;Conceive that at this moment of the
performance the actor who personates Comus flings into the air, or
makes a gesture as if flinging into the air, some powder, which, by a
stage-device, is kindled so as to produce a flash of blue light. In
the original draft among the Cambridge <span class="smcap">MSS.</span>
the phrase is <i>powdered spells</i>; but Milton, by a judicious
change, concealing the mechanism of the stage-trick, substituted
<i>dazzling</i>&rdquo; (Masson).</p>

<p><a name="note_154" id="note_154"></a><a href="#line_150">154.</a>
<b>dazzling</b>. This implies both brightness and illusion. <b>spells</b>. A
<i>spell</i> is properly a magical form of words (A.S. <i>spel</i>, a
<a class="pagebreak" name="Page_56" id="Page_56" title="56"></a>
saying):
here it refers to the whole enchantment employed. <b>spongy air</b>:

<p><a name="note_155" id="note_155"></a><a href="#line_150">155.</a>
<b>Of power to cheat ... and (to) give</b>, etc. These lines are
attributive to &lsquo;spells.&rsquo; The preposition &lsquo;of&rsquo;
is thus used to denote a characteristic; thus &lsquo;of power&rsquo; =
powerful; comp. l. <a href="#line_670">677</a>. <b>blear illusion</b>;
deception, that which deceives by <i>blurring</i> the vision.
Shakespeare has &lsquo;bleared thine eye&rsquo; = dimmed thy vision,
deceived (<i>Tam. Shrew</i>, v. 1. 120). Comp. &ldquo;This may stand
for a pretty superficial argument, to <i>blear</i> our eyes, and lull
us asleep in security&rdquo; (Sir W. Raleigh). <i>Blur</i> is another
form of <i>blear</i>.</p>

<p><a name="note_156" id="note_156"></a><a href="#line_150">156.</a>
<b>presentments</b>, appearances. This word is to be distinguished
from <i>presentiment</i>. A presentiment is a
&ldquo;fore-feeling&rdquo; (Lat. <i>praesentire</i>): while a
presentment is something presented (Lat. <i>praesens</i>, being
before). Shakespeare, <i>Ham.</i> iii. 4. 54, has
&lsquo;presentment&rsquo; in the sense of picture. <b>quaint
habits</b>, unfamiliar dress. Quaint is from Lat. <i>cognitus</i>, so
that its primary sense is &lsquo;known&rsquo; or
&lsquo;remarkable.&rsquo; In French it became <i>coint</i>, which was
treated as if from Lat. <i>comptus</i>, neat; hence the word is
frequent in the sense of neat, exact, or delicate. Its modern sense is
&lsquo;unusual&rsquo; or &lsquo;odd.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="note_158" id="note_158"></a><a href="#line_150">158.</a>

<p><a name="note_161" id="note_161"></a><a href="#line_160">161.</a>
<b>glozing</b>, flattering, wheedling. Compare <i>Par. Lost</i>, ix. 549,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;So <i>glozed</i> the temper, and his proem tuned:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the heart of Eve his words made way.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>Gloze</i> is from the old word <i>glose</i>, a gloss or explanation (Gr.
<i>glossa</i>, the tongue): hence also glossary, glossology, etc. Trench, in
his lecture on the Morality of Words, points out how often fair names
are given to ugly things: it is in this way that a word which merely
denoted an explanation has come to denote a false explanation, an
endeavour to deceive. The word has no connection with <i>gloss</i> =
brightness.</p>

<p><a name="note_162" id="note_162"></a><a href="#line_160">162.</a>
<b>Baited</b>, rendered attractive. Radically <i>bait</i> is the causative of

<b>wind me</b>, etc. The verbs <i>wind</i> (<i>i.e.</i> coil) and
<i>hug</i> suggest the cunning of the serpent. The easy-hearted man is
the person whose heart or mind is easily overcome: &lsquo;man&rsquo;
is here used generically. Burton, in <i>Anat. of Mel.</i>, says:
&ldquo;The devil, being a slender incomprehensible spirit, can easily
insinuate and <i>wind</i> <a class="pagebreak" name="Page_57"
id="Page_57" title="57"></a>himself into human bodies.&rdquo;
<i>Me</i> is here used reflexively: see <a href="#note_61">note</a>,

<p><a name="note_165" id="note_165"></a><a href="#line_160">165.</a>
<b>virtue</b>, <i>i.e.</i> power or influence (Lat. <i>virtus</i>).
This radical sense is still found in the phrase &lsquo;by virtue
of&rsquo; = by the power of. The adjective <i>virtuous</i> is now used
only of moral excellence: in line <a href="#line_620">621</a> it has
its older meaning.</p>

<p><a name="note_166" id="note_166"></a><a href="#line_160">166.</a>
The reading of the text is that of the editions of 1637 and 1645.
In the edition of 1673 the reading was:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">And hearken, if I may, her business here.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But here she comes, I fairly step aside.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But in the errata there was a direction to omit the comma after
<i>may</i>, and to change <i>here</i> into <i>hear</i>. In
Masson&rsquo;s text, accordingly, he reads: &ldquo;And hearken, if I
may her business hear.&rdquo;</p>

<b>keeps up</b>, etc., <i>i.e.</i> keeps occupied with his country
affairs even up to a late hour. <i>Gear</i>: its original sense is
&lsquo;preparation&rsquo; (A.S. <i>gearu</i>, ready); hence
&lsquo;business&rsquo; or &lsquo;property.&rsquo; Comp. Spenser, <i>F.
Q.</i> vi. 3. 6, &ldquo;That to Sir Calidore was <i>easy
gear</i>,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> an easy matter, fairly, softly.
<i>Fair</i> and <i>softly</i> were two words which went together,
signifying <i>gently</i> (Warton).</p>

<p><a name="note_170" id="note_170"></a><a href="#line_170">170.</a>
<b>mine ear ... My best guide</b>. Observe the juxtaposition of
<i>mine</i> and <i>my</i> in these lines. <i>Mine</i> is frequent
before a vowel, especially when the possessive adjective is not
emphatic. In Shakespeare &lsquo;mine&rsquo; is almost always found
before &ldquo;eye,&rdquo; &ldquo;ear,&rdquo; etc., where no emphasis
is intended (Abbott, &sect; 237).</p>

<p><a name="note_171" id="note_171"></a><a href="#line_170">171.</a>
<b>Methought</b>, <i>i.e.</i> it seemed to me. In the verb
&lsquo;methinks&rsquo; <i>me</i> is the dative, and <i>thinks</i> is

from the causal verb &lsquo;I think,&rsquo; which is from A.S.

<b>Echo</b>. In classical mythology she was a nymph whom Juno punished by
preventing her from speaking before others or from being silent after
others had spoken. She fell in love with Narcissus, and pined away until
nothing remained of her but her voice. Compare the invocation to Echo in
Ben Jonson&rsquo;s <i>Cynthia&rsquo;s Revels</i>, i. 1.</p>

<p>The lady&rsquo;s song, which has been described as &ldquo;an
address to the very Genius of Sound,&rdquo; is here very naturally
introduced. The lady wishes to rouse the echoes of the wood in order
to attract her brothers&rsquo; notice, and she does so by addressing
Echo, who grieves for the lost youth Narcissus as the lady grieves for
her lost brothers.</p>

<p><a name="note_232" id="note_232"></a><a href="#line_230">232.</a>
<b>Meander&rsquo;s margent green</b>. Maeander, a river of Asia Minor,
remarkable for the windings of its course; hence the verb &lsquo;to
meander,&rsquo; and hence also (in Keightley&rsquo;s opinion) the
mention of the river as a haunt of Echo. It is more probable, however,
that, as the lady addresses Echo as the &ldquo;Sweet Queen of
Parley&rdquo; and the unhappy lover of the lost Narcissus, the river
is here mentioned because of its associations with music and
misfortune. The Marsyas was a tributary of the Maeander, and the
legend was that the flute upon which Marsyas played in his rash
contest with Apollo was carried into the Maeander and, after being
thrown on land, dedicated to Apollo, the god of song. Comp.
<i>Lyc.</i> 58-63, where the Muses and misfortune are similarly
associated by a reference to Orpheus, whose &lsquo;gory visage&rsquo;
and lyre were carried &ldquo;down the swift Hebrus to the Lesbian
shore.&rdquo;
<a class="pagebreak" name="Page_62" id="Page_62" title="62"></a>
Further, the Maeander is associated with the sorrows of the maiden
Byblis, who seeks her lost brother Caunus (called by Ovid
<i>Maeandrius juvenis</i>). [Since the above was written, Prof. J. W.
Hales has given the following explanation of Milton&rsquo;s allusion:
&ldquo;The real reason is that the Meander was a famous haunt of
swans, and the swan was a favourite bird with the Greek and Latin
writers&mdash;one to whose sweet singing they perpetually
allude&rdquo; (<i>Athenaeum</i>, April 20, 1889).]
&lsquo;Margent.&rsquo; <i>Marge</i> and <i>margin</i> are forms of the
same word.</p>

<p><a name="note_233" id="note_233"></a><a href="#line_230">233.</a>
<b>the violet-embroidered vale</b>. The notion that flowers
<i>broider</i> or ornament the ground is common in poetry: comp.
<i>Par. Lost</i>, iv. 700: &ldquo;Under foot the violet, Crocus, and
hyacinth, with rich inlay <i>Broidered</i> the ground.&rdquo; In
<i>Lyc.</i> 148, the flowers themselves wear &lsquo;embroidery.&rsquo;
The nightingale is made to haunt a violet-embroidered vale because
these flowers are associated with love (see Jonson&rsquo;s <i>Masque
of Hymen</i>) and with innocence (see <i>Hamlet</i>, iv. 5. 158:
&ldquo;I would give you some violets, but they withered all when my
father died&rdquo;). Prof. Hales, however, thinks that some particular
vale is here alluded to, and argues, with much acumen, that the poet
referred to the woodlands close by Athens to the north-west, through
which the Cephissus flowed, and where stood the birthplace of
Sophocles, who sings of his native Colonus as frequented by
nightingales. The same critic regards the epithet
&lsquo;violet-embroidered&rsquo; as a translation of the Greek <span
class="translit"
title="iostephanos">&#7984;&#959;&#963;&#964;&#941;&#966;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span>
(= crowned with violets), frequently applied by Aristophanes to
Athens, of which Colonus was a suburb. Macaulay also refers to Athens
as &ldquo;the violet-crowned city.&rdquo; It is, at least, very
probable that Milton might here associate the nightingale with
Colonus, as he does in <i>Par. Reg.</i> iv. 245: see the following
note.</p>

<p><a name="note_234" id="note_234"></a><a href="#line_230">234.</a>
<b>love-lorn nightingale</b>, the nightingale whose loved ones are
lost: comp. Virgil, <i>Georg.</i> iv. 511: &ldquo;As the nightingale
wailing in the poplar shade plains for her lost young, ... while she
weeps the night through, and sitting on a bough, reproduces her
piteous melody, and fills the country round with the plaints of her
sorrow.&rdquo; <i>Lorn</i> and <i>lost</i> are cognate words, the
former being common in the compound <i>forlorn</i>: see <a
href="#note_39">note</a>, l. 39. Milton makes frequent allusion to the
nightingale: in <i>Il Penseroso</i> it is &lsquo;Philomel&rsquo;; in
<i>Par. Reg.</i> iv. 245, it is &lsquo;the Attic bird&rsquo;; and in
<i>Par. Lost</i> viii. 518, it is &lsquo;the amorous bird of
night.&rsquo; He calls it the Attic bird in allusion to the story of
Philomela, the daughter of Pandion, King of Athens. Near the Academy
was Colonus, which Sophocles has celebrated as the haunt of
nightingales (Browne). Philomela was changed, at her own prayer, into
a nightingale that she might escape the vengeance of her
brother-in-law Tereus. The epithet &lsquo;love-lorn,&rsquo; however,
seems to point to the legend of A&#275;don (Greek <span
class="translit" title="aêdôn">&#7936;&#951;&#948;&#8061;&#957;</span>,
a nightingale), who, having <a class="pagebreak" name="Page_63"
id="Page_63" title="63"></a>killed her own son by mistake, was changed
into a nightingale, whose mournful song was represented by the Greek

<p>The metrical structure of this song should be noted: the lines vary
in length from two to six feet. The rhymes are few, and the effect is
more striking owing to the consonance of <i>shell</i>, <i>well</i>
with <i>vale</i>, <i>nightingale</i>; also of <i>pair</i>,
<i>where</i> with <i>are</i> and <i>sphere</i>; and of <i>have</i>
with <i>cave</i>. Masson regards this song as a striking illustration
of Milton&rsquo;s free use of imperfect rhymes, even in his most
musical passages.</p>

the termination <i>en</i> (<i>e.g.</i> he can <i>speken</i>). The
infinitive, being used as a noun, had a dative form called the gerund,
which was preceded by the preposition <i>to</i>, and when this became
confused with the simple infinitive the use of <i>to</i> became

dale, literally a cleft; hence a valley, not so deep as a dingle.
&lsquo;Bosky bourn,&rsquo; a stream whose banks are bushy or thickly
grown with bushes. &lsquo;Bourn,&rsquo; a boundary, is a distinct word
etymologically, but the phrase &ldquo;from side to side,&rdquo; as
used by Comus, might well imply that the valley as well as the stream
is here referred to. &lsquo;Bosky,&rsquo; bushy. The noun

which is built on the ground. &lsquo;Roost&rsquo; has, however, no
radical connection with <i>rest</i>, but denotes a perch for fowls,
and Keightley&rsquo;s remark that Milton is guilty of supposing the
lark to sleep, like a hen, upon a perch or roost, may therefore be
noticed. But the poets&rsquo; meaning is obvious. Prof. Masson takes

Alice when addressed to a humble shepherd. &lsquo;Courtesy&rsquo; (or,

<b>wont&rsquo;st</b>, <i>i.e.</i> art wont. <i>Wont&rsquo;st</i> is
here apparently the 2nd person singular, present tense, of a verb
<i>to wont</i> = to be accustomed; hence also the participle
<i>wonted</i> (<i>Il Pens.</i> 37, &ldquo;keep thy <i>wonted</i>
state&rdquo;). But the M.E. verb was <i>wonen</i>, to dwell or be
accustomed, and its participle <i>woned</i> or <i>wont</i>. The fact
that <i>wont</i> was a participle being forgotten, it was treated as a
distinct verb, and a new participle formed, viz., <i>wonted</i> (=
won-ed-ed); from this again comes the noun <i>wontedness</i>. Milton,
however, uses <i>wont</i> as a present only twice in his poetry: as in
modern English he uses it as a noun (= custom) or as a participial
adj.

signifies any of the stars in the constellation of the Great Bear, by
which Greek sailors steered; and &lsquo;Tyrian Cynosure&rsquo;
signifies the stars comprising that part of the constellation of the
Lesser Bear which, from its shape, was called <i>Cynosura</i>, the
dog&rsquo;s tail (Greek <span class="translit" title="kynos

a common noun = point of attraction. Both constellations are connected
in Greek mythology with the Arcadian nymph Callisto, who was turned by
Zeus into the Great Bear while her son Arcas became the Lesser Bear.

<b>hapless</b>, unfortunate. Many words, such as happy, lucky, fortunate,
etc., which strictly refer to a person&rsquo;s hap or chance, whether good or
bad, have become restricted to good hap: in order to give them an
unfavourable meaning a negative prefix or suffix is necessary.</p>

<p>With reference to the word <i>fortune</i>, Max M&uuml;ller says:
&ldquo;We speak of good and evil fortune, so did the French, and so
did the Romans. By itself <i>fortuna</i> was taken either in a good or
a bad sense, though it generally meant good fortune. Whenever there
could be any doubt, the Romans defined <i>fortuna</i> by such
adjectives as <i>bona</i>, <i>secunda</i>, <i>prospera</i>, for good;
<i>mala</i> or <i>adversa</i> for bad fortune ... <i>Fortuna</i> came
to mean something like chance.&rdquo;</p>

too ruffled, (3) all-to ruffled. The first of these is given in the
text as it is etymologically correct: <i>to</i> is an intensive prefix
as in &lsquo;to-break&rsquo; = to break in pieces;
&lsquo;to-tear&rsquo; = to tear asunder, etc.; while <i>all</i> (=
quite) is simply an adverb modifying <i>to-ruffled</i>. But about 1500
<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> this idiom was misunderstood, and the
prefix <i>to</i> was detached from the verb and either read along with
<i>all</i> (thus all-to = altogether), or confused with <i>too</i>
(thus all-to = too too, decidedly too). It is doubtful in which sense
Milton used the phrase; like Shakespeare, he may have disregarded its
origin. See Morris, &sect; 324; Abbott, &sect;&sect; 28, 436.</p>

<b>soul grows clotted</b>. This doctrine is expounded in Plato&rsquo;s

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Socrates</i> (speaking of the pure soul). That soul, I say, herself
invisible, departs to the invisible world&mdash;to the divine and
immortal and rational: thither arriving, she is secure of bliss,
and is released from the error and folly of men, their fears and
wild passions and all other human ills, and for ever dwells, as
they say of the initiated, in company with the gods. Is not this
true, Cebes?</p>

<p><i>Cebes.</i> Yes; beyond a doubt.</p>

<p><i>Soc.</i> But the soul which has been polluted, and is impure at
<a class="pagebreak" name="Page_78" id="Page_78" title="78"></a>the
time of her departure, and is the companion and servant of the body
always, and is in love with and fascinated by the body and by the
desires and pleasures of the body, until she is led to believe that
the truth only exists in a bodily form, which a man may touch and
see and taste, and use for the purposes of his lusts&mdash;the soul, I
mean, accustomed to hate and fear and avoid the intellectual
principle, which to the bodily eye is dark and invisible and can be
attained only by philosophy;&mdash;do you suppose that such a soul will
depart pure and unalloyed?</p>

<p><i>Ceb.</i> That is impossible.</p>

<p><i>Soc.</i> She is held fast by the corporeal, which the continual
association and constant care of the body have wrought into her
nature.</p>

<p><i>Ceb.</i> Very true.</p>

<p><i>Soc.</i> And this corporeal element, my friend, is heavy and weighty
and earthy, and is that element by which such a soul is depressed
and dragged down again into the visible world, because she is
afraid of the invisible and of the world below&mdash;prowling about
tombs and sepulchres, in the neighbourhood of which, as they tell
us, are seen certain ghostly apparitions of souls which have not
departed pure, but are cloyed with sight and therefore visible.</p>

<p><i>Ceb.</i> That is very likely, Socrates.</p>

<p><i>Soc.</i> Yes, that is very likely, Cebes; and these must be the
souls, not of the good, but of the evil, who are compelled to
wander about such places in payment of the penalty of their former
evil way of life; and they continue to wander until through the
craving after the corporeal which never leaves them, they are
imprisoned finally in another body. And they may be supposed to
find their prisons in the same natures which they have had in their
former lives.</p></div>

<p>Further on in the same dialogue, Socrates says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Each pleasure and pain is a sort of nail which nails and rivets the
soul to the body, until she becomes like the body, and believes
that to be true which the body affirms to be true; and from
agreeing with the body, and having the same delights, she is
obliged to have the same habits and haunts, and is not likely ever
to be pure at her departure, but is always infected by the
body.&mdash;<i>Extracted from Jowett&rsquo;s Translation of the
Dialogues.</i></p></div>

<b>Thyrsis</b>, Like Lycidas, this name is common in pastoral poetry.
In Milton&rsquo;s <i>Epitaphium Damonis</i> it stands for Milton
himself; in <i>Comus</i> it belongs to Lawes, who now receives
additional praise for his musical genius. In lines <a
href="#line_80">86-88</a> the compliment is enforced by alliterative
verses, and here by the aid of rhyme (<a
href="#line_490">495-512</a>). Masson thinks that the poet, having
spoken of the madrigals of Thyrsis, may have introduced this rhymed
passage in order to prolong the feeling of Pastoralism by calling up
the cadence of known English pastoral poems.</p>

<b>How chance</b>. <i>Chance</i> is here a verb followed by a substantive
clause: &lsquo;how does it chance that,&rsquo; etc. This idiom is common in
Shakespeare (Abbott, &sect; 37), where it sometimes has the force of an
adverb (= perchance): compare <i>Par. Lost</i>, ii. 492: &ldquo;If chance the
radiant sun, with farewell sweet,&rdquo; etc.</p>

&lsquo;sorrowful,&rsquo; the former being common in Spenser, Bacon,
and Shakespeare. Comp. &lsquo;some <i>sad</i> person of known
judgment&rsquo; (Bacon); <i>Romeo and Jul.</i> i. 1. 205, &ldquo;Tell

<b>Chimeras</b>, monsters. Comp. the sublime passage in <i>Par.
Lost</i>, ii. 618-628. The Chimera was a fire-breathing monster, with
the head of a lion, the tail of a dragon, and the body of a goat. It
was slain by Bellerophon. As a common name &lsquo;chimera&rsquo; is
used by Milton to denote a terrible monster, and is now current (in an
age which rejects such fabulous creatures) in the sense of a wild

<b>unweeting</b>; unwitting, unknowing. This spelling is found in
Spenser&rsquo;s <i>Faerie Queene</i>, both in the compounds and in the
simple verb <i>weet</i>, a corruption of <i>wit</i> (A.S.

<b>harrowed</b>, distracted, torn as by a <i>harrow</i>. This is

<b>How sweet ... how near</b>. This sentence contains two

deliverance. Lo, take this herb of virtue, and go to the dwelling of
Circe, that it may keep from thy head the evil day. And I will tell thee
all the magic sleight of Circe. She will mix thee a potion and cast
drugs into the mess; but not even so shall she be able to enchant thee;
so helpful is this charmed herb that I shall give thee ... Therewith the
slayer of Argos gave me the plant that he had plucked from the ground,
and he showed me the growth thereof. It was black at the root, but the
flower was like to milk. <i>Moly</i> the gods call it, but it is hard for
mortal men to dig; howbeit with the gods all things are possible&rdquo;
(<i>Odyssey</i>, x. 280, etc., <i>Butcher and Lang&rsquo;s

&lsquo;Haemonian&rsquo; acquired the sense of &lsquo;magical&rsquo;
(see Ovid, <i>Met.</i> vii 264, &ldquo;<i>Haemonia</i> radices valle

&lsquo;Grain&rsquo; is from Lat. <i>granum</i>, a seed, applied to

certain colours, <i>e.g.</i> Tyrian purple, violet, etc., and is so
used by Milton: see <i>Il Pens.</i> 33, &ldquo;a robe of darkest

<i>grain</i>&rdquo;; xi. 242, &ldquo;A military vest of purple ...
Livelier than ... the <i>grain</i> Of Sarra,&rdquo; etc. And as these
were fast or durable colours we have such phrases as &lsquo;to dye in
grain,&rsquo; &lsquo;a rogue in grain,&rsquo; &lsquo;an ingrained
habit.&rsquo; (See further in Marsh&rsquo;s <i>Lect. on Eng. Lang.</i>

the neglect of the counter-charm the occasion for introducing the

<b>Sabrina</b>: The following is Milton&rsquo;s version of the
legend:&mdash;&ldquo;After this, Brutus, in a chosen place, builds
Troja Nova, changed in time to Trinovantum, now London; and began to
enact laws (Heli being then High Priest in Judea); and, having
governed the whole isle twenty-four years, died, and was buried in his
new Troy. His three sons&mdash;Locrine, Albanact, and
Camber&mdash;divide the land by consent. Locrine had the middle part,
Lo&euml;gria; Camber possessed Cambria or Wales; Albanact, Albania,
now Scotland. But he, in the end, by Humber, King of the Huns, who,
with a fleet, invaded that land, was slain in fight, and his people
driven back into Lo&euml;gria. Locrine and his brother go out against
Humber; who now marching onward was by them defeated, and in a river
drowned, which to this day retains his name. Among the spoils of his
camp and navy were found certain young maids, and Estrilidis, above
the rest, passing fair, the daughter of a king in Germany, from whence
Humber, as he went wasting the sea-coast, had led her captive; whom
Locrine, though before contracted to the daughter of Corineus,
resolves to marry. But being forced and threatened by Corineus, whose
authority and power he feared, Gwendolen the daughter he yields to
marry, but in secret loves the other; and, ofttimes retiring as to
some sacrifice, through vaults and passages made underground, and
seven years thus enjoying her, had by her a daughter equally fair,
whose name was Sabra. But when once his fear was off by the death of
Corineus, not content with secret enjoyment, divorcing Gwendolen, he
makes Estrilidis his Queen. Gwendolen, all in rage, departs into
Cornwall; where Pladan, the son she had by Locrine, was hitherto
brought up by Corineus, his grandfather; and gathering an army of her
father&rsquo;s friends and subjects, gives battle to her husband by
the river Sture, wherein Locrine, shot with an arrow, ends his life.
But not so ends the fury of Gwendolen, for Estrilidis and her daughter
Sabra she throws into a river, and, to have a monument of revenge,
proclaims that the stream be thenceforth called after the
damsel&rsquo;s name, which by length of time is changed now to
<i>Sabrina</i> or Severn.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>History of Britain</i>

adjective with the suffix <i>-en</i> = made of. Most of the adjectives

<b>May thy lofty head</b>, etc. The grammatical construction is:
&lsquo;May thy lofty head be crowned round with many a tower and

groves of myrrh and cinnamon (growing) upon thy banks.&rsquo; This
makes &lsquo;banks&rsquo; objective, and &lsquo;upon&rsquo; a
preposition: the only
<a class="pagebreak" name="Page_105" id="Page_105" title="105"></a>
objection to this reading is that the notion of crowning the head upon
the banks is peculiar. The difficulty vanishes when we recollect that
Milton frequently connects two clauses with one subject rather
loosely: the subject of the second clause is &lsquo;thou,&rsquo;
implied in &lsquo;thy lofty head.&rsquo; An exact parallel to this is
found in <i>L&rsquo;Alleg.</i> 121, 122: &lsquo;whose bright eyes rain
influence and <i>judge</i> the prize&rsquo;; also in <i>Il Pens.</i>
155-7; &lsquo;let my due feet never fail to <i>walk ... and love</i>,
etc.&rsquo;: also in <i>Lyc.</i> 88, 89. The explanation adopted by
Prof. Masson is that Milton had in view two Greek verbs&mdash;<span
class="translit"

title="epistephanoô">&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#966;&#945;&#957;&#8057;&#969;</span>,
&ldquo;to put a crown upon&rdquo;: thus, &ldquo;May thy lofty head be
<i>crowned round</i> with many a tower and terrace, and thy banks here
and there be <i>crowned upon</i> with groves of myrrh and
cinnamon.&rdquo; This makes &lsquo;banks&rsquo; nominative, and
&lsquo;upon&rsquo; an adverb.</p>

<b>not many furlongs</b>. These words are deliberately inserted to
keep up the illusion. It is probable that, in the actual
representation of the mask, the scene representing the enchanted
palace was removed when Comus&rsquo;s rout was driven off the stage,
and a woodland scene redisplayed. This would give additional
significance to these lines and to the change of scene after l. <a

came to mean the length of a field, and is now a measure of

<p><a name="note_949" id="note_949"></a><a href="#line_940">949.</a>
<b>many a friend</b>. &lsquo;Many a&rsquo; is a peculiar idiom, which
has been explained in different ways. One view is that
&lsquo;many&rsquo; is a corruption of the French <i>mesnie</i>, a
train or company, and &lsquo;a&rsquo; a corruption of the preposition
&lsquo;of,&rsquo; the singular noun being then substituted for the
plural through confusion of the preposition with the article. A more
correct view seems to be that &lsquo;many&rsquo; is the A.S.
<i>manig</i>, which was in old English used with a singular noun and
without the article, <i>e.g.</i> <i>manig mann</i> = many men. In the
thirteenth century the indefinite article began to be inserted; thus
<i>mony enne thing</i> = many a thing, just as we say &lsquo;what
<i>a</i> thing,&rsquo; &lsquo;such <i>a</i> thing.&rsquo; This would
seem to show that &lsquo;a&rsquo; is not a corruption of
&lsquo;of,&rsquo; and that there is no connection with the French word
<i>mesnie</i>. Milton, in this passage, uses &lsquo;many a
friend&rsquo; with a plural verb. <b>gratulate</b>. The simple verb is
now replaced by the compound <i>congratulate</i> (Lat.
<i>gratulari</i>, to wish joy to a person).</p>

Milton&rsquo;s own spelling of &lsquo;holiday&rsquo; is
&lsquo;holyday,&rsquo; which shows the origin of the word. The accent
in such compounds (comp. blue-bell, blackbird, etc.) falls on the

and the participle <i>crisped</i>. Compare &ldquo;the <i>crisped</i>
brooks ... ran nectar,&rdquo; <i>Par. Lost</i>, iv. 237, where the
word is best rendered &lsquo;rippled&rsquo;; also Tennyson&rsquo;s

<b>spruce</b>, gay. This word, now applied to persons with a touch of
levity, was formerly used both of things and persons in the sense of
gay or neat. Compare the present and earlier uses of the word
<i>jolly</i>, on which Pattison says:&mdash;&ldquo;This is an instance
of the disadvantage under which poetry in a living language labours.
No knowledge of the meaning which a word bore in 1631 can wholly
banish the later and vulgar associations which may have gathered round
it since. Apart from direct parody and burlesque, the tendency of
living speech is gradually to degrade the noble; so that as time goes
on the range of poetical expression grows from generation to
generation more and more restricted.&rdquo; The origin of the word
<i>spruce</i> is disputed: Skeat holds that it is a corruption of
Pruce (old Fr. <i>Pruce</i>, mod. Fr. <a class="pagebreak"
name="Page_109" id="Page_109" title="109"></a><i>Prusse</i>) =
Prussia; we read in the 14th century of persons dressed after the

English writers up to the beginning of the 17th century. See also

<b>Celestial Cupid</b>. The ordinary view of Cupid is given in the <a
href="#note_445">note</a> to line 445; here he is the lover of Psyche
(the human soul) to whom he is united after she has been purified by a
life of trial and misfortune. The myth of Cupid and Psyche is as
follows: Cupid was in love with Psyche, but warned her that she must
not seek to know who he was. Yielding to curiosity, however, she drew
near to him with a lamp while he was asleep. A drop of the hot oil
falling on him, he awoke, and fled from her. She now wandered from
place to place, persecuted by Venus; but after great sorrow, during
which she was secretly supported by Cupid, she became immortal and was
united to him for ever. In this story Psyche represents the human soul
(Gk. <span class="translit"
title="psychê">&#968;&#965;&#967;&#8053;</span>), which is disciplined
and purified by earthly misfortune and so fitted for the enjoyment of
true happiness in heaven. Further, in Milton&rsquo;s Allegory it is
only the soul so purified that is capable of knowing true love: in his
<i>Apology for Smectymnuus</i> he calls it that Love &ldquo;whose
charming cup is only virtue,&rdquo; and whose &ldquo;first and
chiefest office ... begins and ends in the soul, producing those happy
twins of her divine generation, Knowledge and Virtue.&rdquo; To this
high and mystical love Milton again alludes in <i>Epitaphium
Damonis</i>:</p>

which lie outside these straits, may be here referred to: comp. <i>Par.
Lost</i>, viii. 630:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;But I can now no more; the parting sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond the earth&rsquo;s green Cape and Verdant Isles<br /></span>

<b>bowed welkin</b>: the meaning of the line is, &ldquo;Where the arched sky
curves slowly towards the horizon.&rdquo; <i>Welkin</i> is, radically,
&ldquo;the region of clouds,&rdquo; A.S. <i>wolcnu</i>, clouds.</p>

<p><a name="note_1017" id="note_1017"></a><a href="#line_1010">1017.</a>
<b>corners of the moon</b>, <i>i.e.</i> its horns. The crescent moon is said
to be &lsquo;horned&rsquo; (Lat. <i>cornu</i>, a horn). Comp. the
lines in <i>Macbeth</i>, iii. 5. 23, 24: &ldquo;Upon the corners of
the moon There hangs a vaporous drop profound.&rdquo;</p>

<b>She can teach ye how to climb</b>, etc. Compare Jonson&rsquo;s song to
Virtue:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">&ldquo;Though a stranger here on earth<br /></span>

<p><a name="note_1021" id="note_1021"></a><a href="#line_1020">1021.</a>
<b>sphery chime</b>, <i>i.e.</i> the music of the spheres. &ldquo;To
climb higher than the sphery chime&rdquo; means to ascend beyond the
spheres into the empyrean or true heaven&mdash;the abode of God and
the purest Spirits. Milton therefore implies that by virtue alone can
we come into God&rsquo;s presence. See <a href="#note_112">note</a> on
&ldquo;the starry quire,&rdquo; line 112. &lsquo;Chime&rsquo; is
strictly &lsquo;harmony,&rsquo; as in &ldquo;silver
<i>chime</i>,&rdquo; <i>Hymn Nat.</i> 128: the word is cognate with
<i>cymbal</i>.</p>

<p><a name="note_1022" id="note_1022"></a><a href="#line_1020">1022, 3.</a>
<b>if Virtue feeble were</b>, etc. A triumphant expression of that
confidence in the invincibleness of virtue, when aided by Divine
Providence, and therefore a fitting conclusion of the whole masque.
Milton&rsquo;s whole life reveals his unshaken belief in the truth expressed
in the last two lines of his <i>Comus</i>.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
